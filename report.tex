\section{Objectives} % What did you do to complete this lab? What components (! and tools !) were you learning about? Why do you think we made you do this lab?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Stuff stuff stuff %TODO
	\item More stuff stuff
\end{itemize}

\section{Preparation Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \emph{What is the purpose of all the DCW statements?}

		Write answer here %TODO

	\item \emph{The main program toggles PF1. Neglecting interrupts for this
		part, estimate how fast PF1 will toggle.}

		Write answer here %TODO

	\item \emph{What is in R0 after the first LDR is executed? What is in R0
		after the second LDR is executed?}

		Write answer here %TODO

	\item \emph{How would you have written the compiler to remove an
		instruction?}

		Write definition here %TODO

	\item \emph{100-Hz ADC sampling occurs in the Timer0 ISR. The ISR toggles
		PF2 three times. Toggling three times in the ISR allows you to measure
		both the time to execute the ISR and the time between interrupts. See
		Figure 2.1. Do these two read-modify write sequences to Port F create
		a critical section? If yes, describe how to remove the critical
		section? If no, justify your answer?}

		Write answer here %TODO

\end{enumerate}

\section{Hardware Design} %TODO
% How did you get an analog voltage? Static voltage divider using resistors? Potentiometer? Some sort of sensor?
% If you used hardware debugging tools, describe your process and reasoning.

\section{Software Design} %TODO Description of what you changed or made in terms of software
% Note: While you don't have to include code snippets in your report, please submit code either as a .zip file on canvas or as a link to a Github repo.

\subsection{[TimerX.c]} %TODO For this lab, I would like a summary of each timer you used and what you used it for
% What kind of timer is it? How often should it run? How do you avoid critical sections? Use \verb|this command| for variable and function names and stuff.

\subsection{Explain critical sections and how to remove them}

	Write explanation here %TODO

	\emph{Does the data support CLT? If not, why?}

	Write conclusion here %TODO

\subsection{Hardware averaging time}

	\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{mdf7.jpg}

	\emph{Why is it different?}

	Write reasoning here %TODO

\section{Analysis and Discussion} % Just gotta answer these questions

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \emph{The ISR toggles PF2 three times. Is this debugging intrusive,
		nonintrusive or minimally intrusive? Justify your answer.}

		Write answer here %TODO

	\item \emph{In this lab we dumped strategic information into arrays and
		processed the arrays later. Notice this approach gives us similar
		information we could have generated with a printf statement. In ways
		are printf statements better than dumps? In what ways are dumps better
		than printf statements?}

		Write answer here %TODO

	\item \emph{What are the necessary conditions for a critical section to
		occur? In other words, what type of software activities might result
		in a critical section?}

		Write answer here %TODO

	\item \emph{Define “minimally intrusive”.}

		Write definition here %TODO

	\item \emph{The PMF results should show hardware averaging is less noisy
		than not averaging. If it is so good, why don’t we always use it?}

		Write answer here %TODO
